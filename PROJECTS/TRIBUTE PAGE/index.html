            <li>
              <p><strong>1942</strong>-- Born Cassius Clay on January 17, in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p><strong>1954</strong>-- Begins training as a boxer after his bicycle is stolen. Over next six years,

            <li>
              <p><strong>1964</strong>-- On February 25, Clay goes up against favored Sonny Liston. In what will become
                his trademark, Clay begins taunting Liston, calling him an "ugly old bear," promising to "float like a
                butterfly, sting like a bee." Clay is credited with a knockout and becomes the heavyweight champion of
                the world after Liston fails to come out of his corner for the seventh round. Clay coins the phrase "I
                am the greatest!" -- a phrase for which he will forever be known. On February 26, Clay joins Nation of
